Pushreddit
=========

Once a new submission is noticed this script will send a push notification through Pushover
to every phone setup under the account. This allows the watching of marketplace like subreddits
such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/pipetobaccomarket/">/r/pipetobaccomarket</a> for new submissions.

Requirements:

A Pushover Account - https://pushover.net/
